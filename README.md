### Top Start and End Stations
Using data from the top start stations, we can see which stations will be the most important for bike availabilty.  These areas will need plenty of bikes available as well as space to park the bikes.

### Start and End Stations by Trip Duration
While these stations may not need the high number of bikes available as the top starting and ending stations by number of rides, the bikes at these stations will need to be checked often for maintenance.  We don't want riders getting injured on bikes that are worn down and due for a tune-up.

### Member vs Casual Riders
We can see that the number of both member and casual riders goes up the closer it gets to summer, with the percent of casual riders increasing expectedly in warmer months when people are vacationing.  We can use the data of the top start stations for casual riders and members for several different things.  For example, some stations may need extra bikes available as the number of casual riders increase in the warmer months.  These areas can also be used for additional advertising or general city info.  The top start stations for members are important for upkeep so that members stay happy and keep their memberships.  We can also see from the stations comparing both members and casual riders that Central Park will be an important station for reaching both casual riders and members.
